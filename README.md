**Calculator with History (Python)**

A menu-driven console calculator built using basic Python that performs arithmetic operations and maintains a session-based calculation history.
This project demonstrates core Python concepts such as loops, functions, conditionals, and lists.

**Features**

* Addition

* Subtraction

* Multiplication

* Division (with zero-division handling)

* Continuous execution using loop

* Stores calculation history

* Displays full history on exit

**Tech Stack**

* Python 3

* Core Python concepts (no external libraries)

**Concepts Used**

* Functions

* while loop

* Conditional statements (if-elif-else)

* Lists for history storage

* break statement

* f-strings for formatted output

**Future Enhancements**

* Scientific operations (square root, power, trigonometry)

* Save history to file (TXT / CSV)

* GUI version using Tkinter

* Input validation for non-numeric values
